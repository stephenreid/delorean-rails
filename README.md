## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :test, :development do
  gem 'delorean_test_bed'
end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install delorean_test_bed

Add routes to your routes.rb

```ruby
  mount DeloreanTestBed::Engine, at: '/delorean'
```

## Usage

Browse to [localhost:3000/delorean](http://localhost:3000/delorean), stop (pause),
flux (scale), or accelerate (jump) to the times you need to test.

1. To Reset, Turn the Time Circuits off and Back on
2. To Freeze Time, Turn the Time Circuits Off
3. To Scale Time, enter a value > 1 and flux
4. To Jump to A Time, accelerate (to 88mph) Time will change and continue to run.


### Usage in Test Beds

You may want to know the time factors (start, scale) when writing test beds.
We've built a cache store so that any application (backend/frontend) can share
this information.

```ruby
  DeloreanTestBed::Cache.read(:start)
  DeloreanTestBed::Cache.read(:scale)
  DeloreanTestBed::Cache.read(:future)
```
## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Testing

Please locally test your code. You can test your engine within the dummy app with
```bash
  $ cd test/dummy
  $ rails s
```

Automated tests are handled by mintest (limited to controller thus far)
```bash
  $ rake tests
```
